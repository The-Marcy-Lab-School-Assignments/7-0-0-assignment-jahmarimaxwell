What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

Your answer captures the main idea, but there’s a small issue with the wording. When the setter function is invoked, it updates the state with the new value and causes the component to re-render. Be careful not to confuse the new state value with the initial value—focus on how the setter updates the state. Good effort overall!
