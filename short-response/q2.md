# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer

'useState returns array with two values:
A piece of state data with a starting value
A "setter" function for updating that state data and re-rendering the component.

Your answer is close, but it could be more precise. useState indeed returns an array with two values, but it's important to specify that the first value is the current state value, and the second is a function for setting the next state value. You did a good job overall but be careful to clearly differentiate these roles.
