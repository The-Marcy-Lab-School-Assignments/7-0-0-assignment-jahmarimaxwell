The first component SizeButtons uses the fontSize and setFontSize for the children increaseFontSize and DecreaseFontSize  to increase/decrease font size. The fontSize also is utilized in the LanguageButtons component in order to render the corresponding font size to the H1 greeting tag. Within the LanguageButtons is also the changeLanguage child which renders the changed language to the greeting tag.
